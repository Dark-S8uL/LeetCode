# 🚀 LeetCode Daily Challenges – My Coding Adventure!

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Challenge** repository! 🎯  
Here, I post my solutions to the **daily LeetCode problems** (and other fun challenges) — because nothing says _"I love coding"_ quite like tackling a fresh problem every day! 🧠💡

Each day is a step towards sharper problem-solving skills, better coding techniques, and, of course… crushing those technical interviews. 💪

## 💻 What’s LeetCode?

If you’re new here, **LeetCode** is a treasure trove of programming puzzles — from beginner-friendly warmups to brain-melting hard problems.  
It’s the ultimate playground for developers to:

- Practice coding 🛠️
- Master data structures & algorithms 📚
- Prepare for technical interviews 🏆

## 📅 Daily Uploads

I’ve taken the **At Least One Problem a Day** pledge:

- ✅ **Solve** a new problem _every single day_ (sometimes more!)
- ✅ **Upload** my solution to this repo

Why? Because consistency turns good coders into _great_ coders. And it’s fun to look back and see how far you’ve come! 🚀
